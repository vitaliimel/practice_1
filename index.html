                        the
                        Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional upon the Customer's assent to
                        these
                        Terms and Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to
                        the
                        contrary on the Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at
                        any
                        time and any subsequent orders placed by the Customer will constitute an acceptance of
                        the
                        terms as varied. Once a Customer order has been placed and accepted by Shop, the
                        Customer
                        agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary the order at any time, unless
